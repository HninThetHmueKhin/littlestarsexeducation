## Installation Steps

### 1. Install .NET SDK
- Download from: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download
- Choose ".NET 6.0 SDK" or later
- Run the installer and follow the instructions
- Verify installation by opening Command Prompt and running: `dotnet --version`

### 2. Run Setup Script
- Double-click `setup.bat` in the Setup folder
- Wait for packages to restore and build to complete

### 3. Start the Application
- Open Command Prompt or PowerShell
- Navigate to the Backend folder: `cd Backend`
- Run: `dotnet run`
- Wait for "Now listening on: http://localhost:5000"

### 4. Access the Application
- **Desktop Version**: Open `Desktop/wrapper.html` in your browser
- **Web Version**: Navigate to `http://localhost:5000`
- **Mobile Version**: Use your phone's browser to navigate to `http://localhost:5000`

## Building Executable (.exe)

To create a standalone executable:

```bash
cd Backend
dotnet publish -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained true
```

The executable will be created in:
`Backend/bin/Release/net6.0/win-x64/publish/`

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"dotnet command not found"**
   - Install .NET SDK from the official website
   - Restart Command Prompt after installation

2. **"Port 5000 is already in use"**
   - Close other applications using port 5000
   - Or change the port in Program.cs

3. **"Unable to connect to server"**
   - Make sure the backend is running (`dotnet run`)
   - Check firewall settings
   - Try accessing `http://localhost:5000` directly

4. **Mobile not connecting**
   - Make sure your phone is on the same WiFi network
   - Use your computer's IP address instead of localhost
   - Find your IP: `ipconfig` (Windows) or `ifconfig` (Mac/Linux)
